# Plugin description
description=🔧 Professional vectorization toolkit for QGIS
about=🚀 **ISTools** (Irlan Souza Tools) is a comprehensive QGIS plugin designed for professional GIS workflows, providing essential vectorization tools to streamline vector operations.

    **🛠️ Core Features:**
    • **Extend Lines**: Automatically extend loose line endpoints to connect with nearby features using intelligent snapping algorithms
    • **Polygon Generator**: Create precise polygons from point coordinates with built-in validation and error handling
    • **Bounded Polygon Generator**: Generate polygons within defined frames using delimiter layers for controlled spatial analysis
    • **Point on Surface Generator**: Generate representative points within polygon features for labeling and analysis
    • **Intersection Line**: Insert shared vertices at line intersections within selected areas for precise topology management

    **✨ Key Benefits:**
    • Intuitive user interfaces with modern design principles
    • Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
    • Multi-language support (English/Portuguese)
    • Compatible with various coordinate reference systems
    • Optimized for professional GIS workflows
    • Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)

    **🎯 Perfect for:** Cartographers, GIS analysts, surveyors, urban planners, and geospatial professionals working with vector data processing and geometric operations.
